			<h1>About the Healthy Grocery Builder</h1>
			<p>
				This small app helps you build a healthy grocery list based on the Healthy Eating Plate
				and Pyramid. Use the Create List page to pick items from food groups, add your own items,
				and then view your final list and the percentage breakdown by food group on the View List page.
			</p>
			<p>
				The app is intentionally simple: each food group page contains a curated list of common,
				healthy choices and you can add custom items as needed.
